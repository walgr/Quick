# Gson

Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.

There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.

:information_source: Gson is currently in maintenance mode; existing bugs will be fixed, but large new features will likely not be added. If you want to add a new feature, please first search for existing GitHub issues, or create a new one to discuss the feature and get feedback.

### Goals
* Provide simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa
* Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
* Extensive support of Java Generics
* Allow custom representations for objects
* Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)

### Requirements
#### Minimum Java version
- Gson 2.9.0 and newer: Java 7
- Gson 2.8.9 and older: Java 6

Despite supporting older Java versions, Gson also provides a JPMS module descriptor (module name `com.google.gson`) for users of Java 9 or newer.

#### JPMS dependencies (Java 9+)
These are the optional Java Platform Module System (JPMS) JDK modules which Gson depends on.
This only applies when running Java 9 or newer.

- `java.sql` (optional since Gson 2.8.9)  
  When this module is present, Gson provides default adapters for some SQL date and time classes.

- `jdk.unsupported`, respectively class `sun.misc.Unsafe` (optional)  
  When this module is present, Gson can use the `Unsafe` class to create instances of classes without no-args constructor.
  However, care should be taken when relying on this. `Unsafe` is not available in all environments and its usage has some pitfalls,
  see [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).
